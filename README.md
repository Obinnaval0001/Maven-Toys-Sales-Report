# Maven-Toys-Sales-Report

## Project Description
Maven Toys is analyzing its sales performance in Mexico for a given period to identify opportunities and challenges affecting its revenue, profit, and inventory. The company has observed declining sales in certain areas, potential revenue loss due to low inventory, and varying profitability across product categories and store locations.
The primary issue is to understand why sales are being lost and identify corrective actions to optimize revenue, minimize losses, and ensure a balanced inventory across different store locations.

## Key Questions
The following questions are central to the project:
1. What is the overall revenue, profit, and order volume for Mexico, and how does it compare to last year?
2. Which product categories and locations are driving the most profit?
3. Where are sales being lost, and how much potential revenue is at risk?
4. How does inventory management affect sales and revenue, and what actions can mitigate potential losses?

Based on the above analysis:

###  Revenue and Profit Trends:

* Maven Toys generated $14.44 million in total revenue and $4.01 million in profit from 829K total orders.
* The seasonal trend for 2023 shows higher performance compared to 2022, with a sharp increase in the last quarter.

### Profit by Product Category and Location:

* Downtown locations contribute the highest profits, especially for Toys ($630K) and Electronics ($502K).
* Categories like Art & Crafts and Games also perform well in downtown areas, but they show lower profit margins in residential and airport locations.

### Sales Loss and Inventory Issues:

* The potential revenue loss due to insufficient inventory is $21.84K, with a total inventory value of $300.21K and 17 days of stock remaining.
* Products such as Foam Disk Launchers, Pit Wheel 5-Packs, and Splash Balls are causing sales losses in multiple store locations, including Downtown and Residential stores.

### Summary
The project evaluated the sales performance of Maven Toys in Mexico, identifying revenue and profit drivers and highlighting areas of concern, such as inventory shortages and lost sales opportunities. While downtown locations dominate in profit generation, poor inventory management and stockouts threaten growth in other locations, particularly residential and commercial areas.

## Actions and Recommendations
To address the challenges and capitalize on opportunities:

### Optimize Inventory Management:

* Improve demand forecasting to ensure sufficient stock for high-demand products like Foam Disk Launchers and Pit Wheel 5-Packs.
* Reallocate inventory to locations with higher demand to minimize lost sales.

### Enhance Supply Chain Efficiency:

* Reduce lead times to replenish stock faster and prevent further revenue losses.
* Focus on maintaining at least 30 days of inventory for top-performing products.

### Focus on High-Profit Locations and Categories:

* Invest in marketing and promotions for Downtown stores, as they yield the highest profit.
* Expand product offerings in the Toys and Electronics categories, which have proven most profitable.

### Mitigate Sales Losses:

* Use data analytics to monitor stock levels in real time and trigger alerts for restocking.
* Train store staff to upsell substitute products when primary items are out of stock.
